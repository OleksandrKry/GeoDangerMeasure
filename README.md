CalHacks 10.0 Team project

Inspiration

We had one simple idea that was first able to give you news of a certain area so you can keep up to date for travel and expanded upon that.

What it does

The program gathers news articles, interprets them, and rates the city or area on danger.

How we built it

We mainly used python to build this program.

Challenges we ran into

Connecting the front end to the back end, as well as the trouble of possibly creating a prediction model on future crimes.

Accomplishments that we're proud of

The algorithm that measures the severity of a particular news article as that algorithm was possibly the most abstract.

What we learned

To better manage out time between front and back end as we spent too much time on the back end that we neglected the back end.

What's next for GeoDangerMeasure

Further development on the front end, as well as further research on incorporating an ai prediction model.
